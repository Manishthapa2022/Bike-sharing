## Purpose of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis to convince a potential investor to invest in Bike sharing business in Des Moines Iowa. A through analysis of the Bike sharing business "Citibike" in New York was done to create  set of visualizations

The ollowing results will be shown thrrough the visualization:
- The length of the time that bikes  are checkeed out for all riders and genders
- The number of Bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week

It is a good idea to carry out most of the bike maintenance during the off pea times such as from 12 am to 5 am when the ride numbers drop considerably.

The less number of trips during offfice/business hours could be beacuse of the high number of subscribers who are office goers or could be due to heavy traffic congestion or restrictionson biking during these hours. 

#### **User trips by Gender**

## Summary
After reviewing the visualizations, we can conclude that there are more Subscribers as compared to the customers and most of the subscribers are Males as compared to both Females and Unknown. Also, most of the trips are approx 5 minutes long and mostly concentrated at city center. Furthermore, it can be seen that most of te trips are done during off business hours and less number during business hours. 
Some visiualizations which I would suggest in future would be:
* We should carry out an visualization to see how many women are there as compared to men at NYC city center location. Thi would help us understand if the less number of women subscribers are bacuse of the less number of women or beacuse of fact that women dont subscribe to Bike sharing services. Accordingly we can plan a future course of action based on our analysis.
* We could also carry out visualization of the market share of the CitiBike in NYC aad also the overall numbers of women and men riders within the NYC. This will help us understand the riding habits of males and females and whether other companies are providing some favourable schemes/plan to attract females. 
* Another visualzation should be on how many subscribers are tourists and how many are residents/Office staff. This will help us understand our customer base and we can further develop schemes to attract this group.
